# CamelCupConsole
[Camel Cup](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/153938/camel) is a board game designed by [Steffen Bogen](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/10067/steffen-bogen) and ilustrated by [Dennis Lohausen](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/12484/dennis-lohausen).
## Game Description
In Camel Up, up to eight players bet on five racing camels, trying to suss out which will place first and second in a quick race around a pyramid. The earlier you place your bet, the more you can win â€” should you guess correctly, of course. Camels don't run neatly, however, sometimes landing on top of another one and being carried toward the finish line. Who's going to run when? That all depends on how the dice come out of the pyramid dice shaker, which releases one die at a time when players pause from their bets long enough to see who's actually moving!

## Console Remade
This is a fan-made replica of the board game, but inside Console. First you need to register players and than each player have his turn to choose the action and other options.
I've made some custom commands to help vizualize the board, players and other parts of the game.
